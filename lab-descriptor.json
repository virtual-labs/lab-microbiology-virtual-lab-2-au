Viruses, though not strictly classed as living organisms, are also studied. To study the biochemical properties of microorganisms, the various techniques employed in cultivation of fungi and viruses along with the molecular level analysis of microbial genome. The laboratory course can be further utilized as a self-learning or reference material for life science students.",
